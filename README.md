- 👋 A Little About Me...
 
  Hi, my name's Ceyhun Yildiz, and I've been obsessed with technology for as long as I can remember. I wrote my first lines of code at 15, and I’ve been building full-stack products ever since—across startups, agencies, and scaling companies in multiple industries.

  My core expertise revolves around **TypeScript and the modern web ecosystem**. After nearly a decade working with JS/TS in production, I’ve experienced both its elegance and its chaos. That experience helps me design clean architectures, avoid common pitfalls, and ship reliable, scalable software.

  I've built everything from high-traffic **eCommerce platforms** and **SaaS applications with millions of users**, to lean, efficient solutions for larger businesses and teams.
