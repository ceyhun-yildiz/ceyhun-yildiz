- ðŸ‘‹ A Little About Me...
 
  Hi, my name's Ceyhun Yildiz and since a young age I've had an obsession for nearly anything tech-related. I've been coding since about the age of 15 (half of my life, now...phew!) and have worked as a full-stack web developer in various companies and industries.

  My specialities mainly gravitate around one central language (and my first love) - JavaScript. I've been programming with it for around 10 years and - as with any long-term relationship - have had the pleasure of seeing it's ugly side as well as it's beautiful side. So I know the pitfalls to avoid when using it, and pass these on when appropriate in my projects.

  I've also helped many companies to create very popular, UK-based eCommerce websites, as well as a large amount of smaller, independent websites as well.

  Other languages & technologies I've used and have experience with are - React.js, Node.js, Python, Solidity, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, HTML & CSS.
